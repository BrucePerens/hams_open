//! Fixed-point port of `ambe::float::ratet27::enhancement` (Eq. 105-116) -- spectral amplitude
//! enhancement and adaptive smoothing. **The float sibling's own doc comment specifically warns
//! that Eq. 112 (`V_M`'s `epsilon_T <= 4` branch) and Eq. 115 (`tau_M`'s `epsilon_T <= 6` branch)
//! are two different numbers for two different variables, easily conflated** -- ported here with
//! that same care, each threshold kept next to its own real equation number in a comment, not
//! merged or assumed identical.
//!
//! **Energy-domain quantities need a wider range than plain Q16.16, not a different Q-format.**
//! Live chip data (`examples/ambe_fixed_chip_validate_ratet27.rs`'s own `R_M0` range print) shows
//! real `R_M0` (Eq. 105, the sum of squared spectral amplitudes) spans roughly 9 to 4x10^8 across
//! real decoded speech -- 8 orders of magnitude, far beyond Q16.16's own ~32767 real-valued ceiling,
//! and far beyond what any single linear rescale (dividing by one fixed constant before storing in
//! an `i32`) could cover at both ends at once. `R_M0`, `R_M1` (Eq. 106), `S_E` (Eq. 111), `tau_M`
//! (Eq. 115), and `A_M` (Eq. 114) are therefore kept as `i64` with the *same* 16 fractional bits as
//! everywhere else in this crate (`real = raw / 65536`, see [`super::super::general::fixed_ops::
//! mul_q16_i64`]/[`super::super::general::explog::log2_q16_i64`]) -- not a second Q-format, just a
//! wider container for the same convention, since Q16.16's *fractional* precision (16 bits) was
//! never the problem, only its *integer* range (31 usable bits in an `i32`).
//!
//! [`weight_q16`] (Eq. 107) can't just widen its container, though: its own float formula computes
//! `r_m0^2`, and squaring a value that may already need 30+ bits would need a 128-bit product merely
//! to stay exact, before ever dividing back down by another one. Instead it's algebraically
//! rewritten in terms of `k = R_M1/R_M0` (a dimensionless ratio, bounded to `[-1,1]` by
//! Cauchy-Schwarz, since `|R_M1| <= R_M0`) -- substituting `R_M1 = k*R_M0` into the float formula's
//! own `(R_M0^2 + R_M1^2 - 2*R_M0*R_M1*cos) / (omega0*R_M0*(R_M0^2-R_M1^2))` cancels every `R_M0^2`
//! term down to a single, un-squared `R_M0` in the denominator -- and the whole ratio is then
//! evaluated in the *log* domain (`log2(weight) = 0.5*log2(M_l) + 0.25*log2(ratio)`, `exp2`'d back at
//! the end) so that single `R_M0` factor only ever needs [`super::super::general::explog::
//! log2_q16_i64`], never a full-width division or multiplication of the raw energy value itself.
