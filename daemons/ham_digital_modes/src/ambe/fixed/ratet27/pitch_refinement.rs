//! Fixed-point quarter-sample pitch refinement (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 5.1.5): the 256-point
//! windowed DFT `S_w(m)`, the harmonic amplitude `A_l` (Eq. 26-28), the synthetic spectrum (Eq. 25), the
//! refinement error `E_R` (Eq. 24) and [`refine_pitch`]. Fixed-point sibling of
//! [`crate::ambe::float::ratet27::pitch_refinement`].
//!
//! # Pitch representation: [`Pitch`] (an exact fraction), and `P8` for the refinement search
//!
//! The refinement returns a period in eighths of a sample, `P8`; [`Pitch`] wraps either a `P8` or an
//! arbitrary `omega0` (needed by the voicing/amplitude analysis at a decoder-quantized pitch) in the
//! exact-fraction form the band arithmetic uses. Every pitch the refinement examines is `p_hat_i +- k/8` with `p_hat_i` a half-sample candidate, so
//! the period is an exact integer `P8 = 8 * P`. With `omega0 = 2*pi/P` every place the float code
//! multiplies by `omega0` and by `256/(2*pi)` or `16384/(2*pi)` cancels the `pi`:
//!
//! * band edges `a_l = 256 (l - 1/2) / P = 1024 (2l - 1) / P8` (and `b_l = a_{l+1}`),
//! * window-DFT index `floor(64 m - 16384 l / P + 1/2) = floor((128 m P8 - 262144 l + P8) / (2 P8))`,
//! * `L_est = floor(0.9254 P / 2 - 1/2)`.
//!
//! All are evaluated with exact integer division, so no fixed-point `pi` or reciprocal is needed and
//! the band/bin bookkeeping cannot drift from the real-number definition. [`omega0_q30_from_p8`]
//! converts to radians per sample (Q30) for the consumers that need `omega0` itself.
//!
//! # Numeric formats
//!
//! * `S_w(m)`: complex, each part an `i64` in Q10 (a 16-bit input times the window sum 110 is below
//!   `2^23`, so Q10 is below `2^33`). Computed from `raw * w_R` (Q10) times a Q30 cosine table, exact
//!   to rounding of each partial product; `m < 0` uses conjugate symmetry of a real input.
//! * `W_R(m)`: Q22 table for `|m| <= 512` (indices beyond that are treated as 0; the reachable
//!   range for pitches of at least 19.875 is about 476).
//! * Harmonic amplitude `A_l`: Q16 complex `i64` (`num / den` with `num = sum S_w W_R` in Q32 and
//!   `den = sum W_R^2` in Q44, both `i128`).
//! * Error/energy sums: `i128`, Q60 (`|diff|^2` of Q30 differences).
//!
//! # Verification (see `tests/ambe_fixed_ratet27_pitch_refinement.rs`)
//!
//! On real speech (all 7748 frames of the four `osr_speech` files, the same initial pitch handed to
//! both implementations) the refined period `P8` equals the float sibling's refined period, to the
//! eighth of a sample, on 99.99% of frames (one frame differs, by one eighth), and `E_R` at the chosen
//! period agrees to a worst-case relative error of 7.0e-5.
