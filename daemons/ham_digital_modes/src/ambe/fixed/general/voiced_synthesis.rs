//! Fixed-point port of [`super::super::float::tia_102_baba::voiced_synthesis`] (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf
//! section 11.3, Eq. 127-141) -- see that module's own doc comment for the spec derivation, the two
//! documented notational resolutions (the bare `L~` in Eq. 140, and `phi_l(0)` for harmonics beyond
//! `max[L~(-1), L~(0)]`), both reused unchanged here.
//!
//! **The one genuinely new fixed-point risk this module has that `unvoiced_synthesis` doesn't**:
//! `psi_l`/`phi_l` (Eq. 139-140) are phase *accumulators* that add a per-frame increment forever,
//! for the lifetime of a call -- unlike everything in `unvoiced_synthesis`, which only ever combines
//! bounded, per-frame or per-sample quantities. A per-frame increment
//! (`(omega0_prev+omega0_curr)*l*N/2`, up to a few thousand radians at high harmonics) fits an `i32`
//! Q16.16 easily on its own, but the float sibling's own running `f64` sum of *many* such increments
//! grows without bound -- ported literally as a growing Q16.16 `i32`, it would overflow within a few
//! hundred frames (a handful of seconds of real audio), long before any real call to this module
//! would end.
//!
//! **The fix**: `psi`/`phi` are stored as this crate's own wrapping `u32` *phase* (`fixed::general::
//! trig`'s own convention, `1u32 << 32` = one full turn) rather than as growing Q16.16 radians --
//! `u32::wrapping_add` never overflows, and a phase's own wraparound *is* the mod-`2*pi` reduction a
//! real angle needs anyway, not a bug to guard against. Each frame's own per-harmonic increment (and
//! the dither term) is computed as an ordinary *bounded* Q16.16 radian value first (safe, since it's
//! never itself accumulated across frames) and converted to a phase *delta* via `trig::
//! phase_from_radians_q16` only at the point it's added to the persistent phase. The reverse
//! conversion, `trig::radians_from_phase_q16`, recovers a bounded `(-pi, pi]` radian value from the
//! stored phase whenever the per-sample synthesis formulas below need to add it to another genuine
//! radian quantity (`theta_l(n)`'s own `omega0*n*l` term, etc.) before a final `cos`/`sin` -- see that
//! function's own doc comment for why interpreting the same bits as `i32` gives exactly the right
//! symmetric-around-zero representative for free.
