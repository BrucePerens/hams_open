//! Fixed-point port of [`super::super::float::tia_102_baba::unvoiced_synthesis`] (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf
//! section 11.2, Eq. 117-126) -- see that module's own doc comment for the spec derivation and the
//! `kchmck/imbe.rs` cross-check; this module only documents the *fixed-point-specific* choices.
//!
//! Lives under `fixed::general`, not `fixed::tia_102_baba`, on purpose: this synthesis stage is
//! mode-independent MBE (mbelib itself shares one `mbe_synthesizeSpeech` across every mode), and
//! TIA-102.BABA is only the first mode with a float reference to port from -- AMBE+2 half-rate/D-STAR
//! will reuse this unchanged once/if they grow their own synthesis.
//!
//! **Numeric design, decided before writing any arithmetic below**: the noise recurrence (Eq. 117)
//! and its `NoiseState` window are *already* pure integer in the float sibling (no `f64` anywhere in
//! that state), so they're duplicated here verbatim rather than "ported" -- there is nothing to
//! convert. Everything downstream of it is genuinely real-valued and needs a real fixed-point format,
//! but at a much wider range than this crate's usual Q16.16 `i32`: `u(n)` itself ranges `0..53125`
//! (unnormalized, not `[-1,1]`), so the windowed noise DFT's own per-bin magnitude can reach the
//! hundreds of thousands in real terms -- `gamma_w * M_l` (the final per-band rescale target) can
//! itself exceed an `i32` Q16.16's `~32767` real ceiling for a loud harmonic. So every complex
//! spectral value in this pipeline (`ComplexQ16`, `unvoiced_dft_q16`'s output, the rescaled spectrum)
//! is kept as **`i64` Q16.16** throughout, narrowing back to a normal `i32` Q16.16 PCM sample only at
//! the very last step (the overlap-add output), matching `fixed_ops::mul_q16_i64`/`div_q16_i64`'s own
//! "wide container, same 16-fractional-bit convention" idiom used elsewhere in this crate.
//!
//! **A wide square root, not a "square everything first" reorganization**: Eq. 120's own
//! `scale = gamma_w * M_l / sqrt(power)` needs the square root of a value that can be far larger than
//! what [`super::fixed_ops::sqrt_q16`] (a plain `i32` result) can hold -- `sqrt(power)` itself is on
//! the same large scale as a DFT bin magnitude, not a normal Q16.16 quantity. An earlier version of
//! this module instead squared the whole scale factor first (`(gamma_w*M_l)^2 / power`, reasoning
//! that would land back in a normal small range before one final ordinary `sqrt_q16`) -- but that
//! makes the intermediate ratio *smaller* exactly when it's already small (a quiet harmonic, where
//! `scale` itself might be `~0.003`), and squaring a small ratio can underflow Q16.16's own
//! resolution entirely before the final sqrt ever runs (confirmed directly: a real quiet-frame test
//! measured only `~13 dB` SNR against float with that approach, far under this port's `40 dB` bar).
//! [`super::fixed_ops::sqrt_wide_q16`] avoids the overflow at its root (a normalize-shift-then-unshift
//! trick, not squaring anything first) -- but a *second*, related regression surfaced even after
//! that fix, at a still-quieter amplitude (peak `0.5`, near the real chip's own observed `R_M0`
//! floor): precomputing `scale = gamma_w * M_l / sqrt_wide_q16(power)` as its own `i32` Q16.16 value
//! before multiplying every bin by it throws away precision *scale itself* doesn't have room for at
//! that magnitude (`~0.0001`, a handful of representable Q16.16 levels), even though the *final*
//! rescaled bin (`~gamma_w * M_l` in size) does. The fix: never materialize `scale` at all --
//! [`mul_div_wide`] rescales each bin as `(bin * gamma_w * M_l) / sqrt_wide_q16(power)` in one
//! `i128`-widened division per component, so the only rounding that happens is the one the *final*,
//! properly-sized result actually needs.
