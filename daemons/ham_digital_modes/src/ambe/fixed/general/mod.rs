//! Fixed-point arithmetic primitives shared across every mode's own fixed-point port -- the

//! implementations call directly (`sin`/`cos`, `exp2`/`log2`-style operations via `.exp()`/`.log2()`
//! on a base-e or base-2 quantity, and `sqrt`). See [`super`]'s own doc comment for the numeric
//! convention (Q16.16 unless stated otherwise) and the tolerance each primitive is held to.
