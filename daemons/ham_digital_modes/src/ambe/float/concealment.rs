//! Damaged-frame concealment for the D-STAR and AMBE+2 half-rate decoders (`ErrorPolicy::Concealing`), designed for audio quality
//! rather than for compatibility with any reference decoder.
//!
//! Two facts about these frames drive the design. First, only 47 of the 72 bits are error protected (the two Golay blocks); the other
//! 25 arrive raw, and they include the whole voicing pattern in D-STAR, the low bits of the gain, the pitch and the spectral shape.
//! Second, speech parameters change slowly from frame to frame. So for each frame the decoder considers a few candidate readings
//! of the raw bits (as received, and each single-bit correction of the bits that matter most) and picks the one with the smallest
//! total cost, in nats: a flip costs `ln((1-p)/p)` for the current bit error rate estimate `p` (learned from how many errors the
//! Golay blocks corrected), and each candidate pays a continuity cost against the previous accepted frame (Laplace-shaped
//! priors on the level change, spectral shape change, voicing change and pitch change, with scales measured on real speech by
//! `examples/ambe_frame_statistics.rs`). If even the best candidate is implausible, the previous frame is repeated with a fade
//! instead of muting; the predictor state is only advanced by accepted frames.
//!
//! Which bits are worth correcting was measured with `examples/ambe_bit_sensitivity.rs`.
