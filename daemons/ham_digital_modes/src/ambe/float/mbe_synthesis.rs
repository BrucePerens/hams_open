//! Mode-independent MBE frame synthesis shared by D-STAR and AMBE+2 half-rate: turns one frame's
//! already-dequantized `(w0, per-harmonic voicing, Ml)` into 20 ms of PCM by reusing
//! [`super::tia_102_baba::synthesis::SynthesisState`] (spectral enhancement, V/UV and amplitude
//! smoothing, then voiced + unvoiced synthesis, Eq. 105-142).
//!
//! mbelib runs one shared `mbe_synthesizeSpeechf` for P25, D-STAR and AMBE+2, and its
//! `mbe_spectralAmpEnhance` is the same Eq. 105-110 enhancement `tia_102_baba::enhancement` implements
//! (0.96*pi constant, harmonics with `8*l <= L` left unweighted, weights clamped to `[0.5, 1.2]`,
//! energy renormalized), so the parameter set is identical across modes and nothing here is
//! mode-specific. Two deliberate differences from mbelib remain: this crate's unvoiced half is the
//! spec's DFT construction rather than mbelib's multisine mix, and `SynthesisState` also applies the
//! spec's V/UV and amplitude smoothing, which mbelib omits.
//!
//! FEC error statistics feed the same smoothing thresholds as TIA-102.BABA, using the two Golay blocks
//! these two modes actually carry (`epsilon_c0`, `epsilon_c1`) and zero for the vectors they lack.
