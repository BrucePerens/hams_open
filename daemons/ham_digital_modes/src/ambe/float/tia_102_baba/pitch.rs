//! Pitch estimation (TIA-102.BABA_2003.pdf section 5.1): the analysis window and lowpass filter tables, the error
//! function (Eq. 5), and the look-back and look-ahead tracking (5.1.2-5.1.4). Refinement (5.1.5) is in
//! `pitch_refinement`.
//!
//! # Real transcription methodology for both tables below
//!
//! Both Annex B (this window) and Annex D (the filter) are, like Annexes E/F/G/J, real extractable
//! PDF text (confirmed via `pdfimages -list`, zero embedded images), not bit-matrix figures -- lower
//! transcription risk than `fec.rs`'s Golay/Hamming matrices from the start. Each was still checked
//! against a real, spec-mandated invariant before being trusted, not read on faith:
//!
//! - **Annex B** (301 values, `n` from -150 to 150): the spec's own Eq. 6 requires `sum(w_I(j)^2 for
//!   j in -150..=150) == 1.0` -- measured directly against the parsed table: `1.0000000356`,
//!   matching to within the rounding error inherent in the spec's own 8-decimal-digit printed values.
//!   Also confirmed `w_I(n) == w_I(-n)` for all 150 pairs (the spec's own stated symmetry
//!   convention), so only the non-negative half needs to be stored.
//! - **Annex D** (21 taps, `n` from -10 to 10): the raw extracted text has `n=-1`'s own sign character
//!   dropped (a real, minor extraction glitch, not the watermark-collision problem `tables.rs` deals
//!   with) -- recovered via the same symmetry property (`h(n) == h(-n)`, confirmed exactly for all
//!   other 9 pairs, so `h(-1) == h(1)` is not a guess but the same pattern every other coefficient
//!   already follows). DC gain (`sum(h(n))`) measures `1.00138`, close to the unity gain a lowpass
//!   filter's coefficients are conventionally normalized to, with the small residual consistent with
//!   21 coefficients each carrying their own printed 6-decimal-digit rounding.

/// Annex B: the 301-sample window used for initial pitch estimation, `w_I(n)`. Only the non-negative
/// half (`n = 0..=150`) is stored; `w_I(n) == w_I(-n)` per the spec's own stated symmetry convention,
/// confirmed exactly for all 150 pairs during transcription.
