//! Floating-point AMBE implementations, one module per radio mode. This is the original layout
//! this codebase's AMBE work was built in (each mode used to be its own top-level `crate::ambe`/
//! `crate::ambe_dstar`/`crate::ambe_plus_2` module) -- moved under `ambe::float::<mode>` so
//! [`super::fixed`] can mirror it mode-for-mode without a naming collision. Code shared across more
//! than one mode that is *not* precision-specific lives in [`super::general`] instead, a sibling of
//! this module rather than a child of it.
// Gated off by default, pending patent clearance for any real deployment use -- see this module's
// own doc comment and AMBE_PLUS_2_NOTES.md for the authorization history and scope. Build/test
// with `cargo build/test --features ambe_plus_2`.
